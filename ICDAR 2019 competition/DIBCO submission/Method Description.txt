Method Description: 
Our binarization method follows a two-stage approach. 
The first stage consists of background separation and the second stage contains binarization technique. 
For background separation, firstly a superset of foreground estimated by Niblack’s method which acts as a mask. 
Then, the background surfaced image is obtained which is followed by image normalization. 
The binarization technique comprises clustering combination approach. 
To incorporate the positive sides of various clustering algorithms, combination of three popular clustering algorithms is adopted.
